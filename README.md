## Description

When most people want to travel, they have to make  intensive decisions on the place to visit. This requires a lot of time and can be a hectic process . In many cases people have been caught up in their busy daily schedule hence leading to ineffective planning which end up to poor and boring experiences.
Developing Tembea web application  will simplify the userâ€™s decision making process when it comes to vacation planning.  This will be achieved by suggesting destinations and activities to indulge in, according to their budget and interests at the time of travel.<br>

We came accross some very interesting facts during gathering the user requirements stage.

Here's a snipet:
* Did you know that people do really love travelling? :neutral_face::neutral_face:
* These same people would just opt for staying at home to avoid the hectic planning. :anguished: :anguished:
* Users really want to feel the value for their money when travelling :hushed::hushed:
* Many users have had vacations basically to sleep in beautiful expensive sceneries just because they could not come up with an itinerary of activities :anguished: :anguished::anguished: :anguished:
* There's more tea where that came from  and solutions to these insights. Follow us for more :anguished: :anguished:
